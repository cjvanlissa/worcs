Note data synthesis work properly, essential class variables defined correctly. default algorithm ranger supports numeric, integer, factor, logical data. types variables converted one types. Users can provide use custom model_expression predict_expression use different algorithm calling synthetic. demonstrated example, users call lm model_expression use linear regression, preserves linear marginal relationships can give rise values range original data. users call sample predict_expression bootstrap variable, quick solution maintains univariate distributions loses marginal relationships. examples exhaustive, users can even create custom functions.","code":""},{"path":"https://cjvanlissa.github.io/worcs/reference/synthetic.html","id":"references","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"References","title":"Generate synthetic data — synthetic","text":"Nowok, B., Raab, G.M Dibben, C.
