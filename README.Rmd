The Workflow for Open Reproducible Code in Science (WORCS) is an easy to adopt approach to ensuring a research project meets the requirements of Open Science from the start. It is based on a "good enough" philosophy, prioritizing user-friendliness over exhaustiveness. It can be used either in absence of, or in parallel to, existing requirements for Open workflows. It can also be enhanced with more elaborate solutions for specific issues.

## Where do I start?

For most users, the recommended starting point is to [read the paper](https://osf.io/zcvbs/), currently in press in [Data Science](https://content.iospress.com/journals/data-science/Pre-press/Pre-press),
which introduces the WORCS workflow, explains the underlying tools, and illustrates how the `worcs` package can be used to create a new project that follows the workflow.

The workflow is illustrated below; the [workflow vignette](https://cjvanlissa.github.io/worcs/articles/workflow.html) describes each step in detail.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/cjvanlissa/worcs/raw/master/paper/workflow_graph/workflow.png")
```


## Installing the package

Before installing the package, please read [this vignette](https://cjvanlissa.github.io/worcs/articles/setup.html), which explains how to set up your computer for `worcs`.

After reading [the vignette](https://cjvanlissa.github.io/worcs/articles/setup.html), you can install the development version of the `worcs` package from GitHub with:

``` r
if(!requireNamespace("remotes"))install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("cjvanlissa/worcs", dependencies = TRUE, update = "never")
tinytex::install_tinytex()
worcs::git_user("your_name", "your_email")
```

If you intend to write APA style manuscripts, you can additionally install the `papaja` package:

``` r
remotes::install_github("crsh/papaja", dependencies = TRUE, update = "never")

```


## Citing WORCS

You can cite WORCS using the following citation (please use the same citation for either the package, or the paper):

## About this repository

This repository contains the following:

1.  An R-package called `worcs`, with convenience functions to facilitate the WORCS workflow.
2.  In the subfolder `./paper`, the source files for the paper describing the WORCS workflow.

The repository serves two functions: To allow users to install the `worcs` package, and to allow collaborators access to the source code for the package and paper.

## Adoption of WORCS by users

```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(gh)
library(dlstats)
dl <- dlstats::cran_stats("worcs")
dl <- sum(dl$downloads)

worcs_repo <- gh("/repos/cjvanlissa/worcs")

repos <- gh("GET /search/code", username = "cjvanlissa", q="worcs_version filename:.worcs")

worcs_repos <- data.frame(t(sapply(repos[["items"]], function(x){
  c(owner = x$repository$owner$login,
    name = x$repository$name,
    url = x$repository$html_url
  )
})))

worcs_repos <- worcs_repos[!((worcs_repos$owner %in% c("cjvanlissa", "cran") & worcs_repos$name == "worcs")| grepl("(penguin|\\btmp|demo|test)", tolower(worcs_repos$name))), ]

tmp <- paste0(sapply(unique(worcs_repos$owner), function(x){
  owner_repos <- worcs_repos[worcs_repos$owner == x, , drop = FALSE]
  paste0("\n    - ", x, "  ",
         paste0("\n        + [", owner_repos$name, "](", owner_repos$url, ")  ", collapse = ""))
  }),
  collapse = "")

invited <- read.table("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cjvanlissa/resume/master/invited.csv", sep = ",", header = TRUE)
invited <- invited[grepl("(worcs|workflow)", tolower(invited$Topic)), c("Institute", "Year", "City", "Country", "Date")]
invited <- paste0(apply(invited, 1, function(x){paste0("\n    - ", x[1], " (", x[2], ")  ")}), collapse = "")
