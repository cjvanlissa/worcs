# Reproducibility

This project uses the Workflow for Open Reproducible Code in Science (WORCS) to
ensure transparency and reproducibility. The workflow is designed to meet the
principles of Open Science throughout a research project. 

To learn how WORCS helps researchers meet the TOP-guidelines and FAIR principles,
read the preprint at https://osf.io/zcvbs/

## WORCS: Advice for authors

* To get started with `worcs`, see the [setup vignette](https://cjvanlissa.github.io/worcs/articles/setup.html)
* For detailed information about the steps of the WORCS workflow, see the [workflow vignette](https://cjvanlissa.github.io/worcs/articles/workflow.html)

## WORCS: Advice for readers
